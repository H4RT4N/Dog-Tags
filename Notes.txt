What we are 100% sure we want the game to have:
- Bullet hell gameplay
  - 45 degree perspective
  - 360 degree shooting for player
  - Bullet behavior

Pending decisions: 
- story
- art
- sound/music

Notes:
Hi guys we lost an artist and I think we should fall back to implementing gameplay.

Here's an idea: what if we all make our own demo and at the next meeting we decide who's we should continue working on?
